# TypeScript Type Error: String to Number

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: attempting to add a string and a number.  TypeScript's type system prevents this to maintain type safety and catch potential errors during development.  The solution shows how to address this using type guards or type assertions.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory using your terminal.
3. Run `tsc bug.ts` to compile the buggy code.  You should see a compilation error.
4. Run `tsc bugSolution.ts` to compile the corrected code.  This should compile successfully.
